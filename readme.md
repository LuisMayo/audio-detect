# Audio Detect

If you have a certain sound effect that's played multiple times in an audio file (e.g. an MP3), I'd like to identify when that happens.

Otherwise known as Audio Event Detection.

I don't have the solution yet, but my experiments in Python, primarily using "librosa", can be found in the [testing](./testing/) folder.
